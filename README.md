## About

The exhibition has no fixed entrance point: the navigation is randomised. <br>
There is no beginning and no end. <br>
There are no temporal hierarchies during the journey. <br>
Feel free to randomly navigate this space at your leisure. <br>
The search engine and artists list will guide you, should you wish to immediately locate the work of specific contributors.

This is the official repository for the construction of the Website **AUSSICHT.SPACE** for the upcoming MAK Exhibtion **Aus Heutiger Sicht: Diskurse Ã¼ber die Zukunft**.
